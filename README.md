</p>

## Install

You need Claude Code v2.1.287 or later (`claude --version`).

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Namenomeaning/pixel-pet
claude plugin install pixel-pet@pixel-pet
```

Start a new session, or run `/reload-plugins` in an open one. The slime appears above the prompt.

To uninstall, run `claude plugin uninstall pixel-pet@pixel-pet`.

## What the pet does

| When | The pet |
| --- | --- |
| Claude is idle | Breathes, blinks, and looks around. Falls asleep after the **Sleep after** time, a minute by default. |
| A turn starts | Bounces in place |
| A tool call ends | Walks back and forth for 4 seconds |
| Claude thinks longer | Looks around, with `?` and dots |
| `Read` | Reads a book: `reading app.ts` |
| `Grep`, `Glob` | Sweeps a magnifier: `hunting for "useState"` |
| `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`, `TodoWrite` | Writes with a pen: `editing app.ts` |
| `Bash`, and any tool not listed | Types in a small terminal: `$ npm test` |
| `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` | Spins a globe: `fetching docs.anthropic.com` |
| A subagent starts | Smiles. A mini joins the trail behind the pet and stays until that subagent finishes. It leaves with a sparkle, or grey if the subagent failed. |
| A tool call fails | `x x` eyes and a sweat drop |
| A turn ends | Cheers |

## The HUD

A pixel window below the prompt holds up to three bars:

- **♥ HP** is the context window left. It turns yellow at 50 % or less, red at 25 % or less, and shows `/compact` under 10 %.
- **✦ MP** is the 5-hour rate limit left, with the time to its reset, such as `reset in 4h26m`.
- **◆ ST** is the 7-day rate limit left, with the time to its reset, such as `reset in 3d4h`.

MP and ST turn red under 15 %. Each shows on Pro and Max plans once a response has reported its limit.

While the pet idles or thinks, its face follows the HUD: it sweats at 50 % HP or less, gets `x x` eyes at 25 % HP or less, and looks tired under 20 % MP or ST.

## Make it yours

<p align="center">

</p>

Ask Claude in any session, or run `/pixel-pet:pixel-pet`. You can change:

- **the pet**: "set up my pet as a rubber duck", "make the slime purple";
- **its props and effects**: "a UFO tablet when it reads", "a radar dish for web searches", "no question mark when it thinks";
- **its minis**: "a tiny saucer for each subagent";
- **the text**: "alien status lines", "make the bash line red";
- **the HUD**: "a green frame", "rename HP to FUEL", "hide ST";
- **the scene**: "a moon surface with rocks along the ground", "grass and flowers behind the pet";
- **the settings** below, such as speed and sleep.

Claude opens a preview in your browser first: every motion, face, status line, and HUD look, and the pet running through its scene, on a dark or a light background. Say what to change, and Claude redraws it. When you approve, the change shows above the prompt at once and stays for later sessions. To undo, ask for the slime back.

All of it lives in one theme, a JSON file documented in [`FORMAT.md`](plugins/pixel-pet/skills/pixel-pet/FORMAT.md). [`alien.json`](plugins/pixel-pet/assets/alien.json) uses every field. To share a theme, ask Claude to save it as a file. To use someone else's, ask Claude to load their file.

## Settings

In a session, run `/plugin configure pixel-pet@pixel-pet`.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | `normal` | How quickly the pet runs and animates: `slow`, `normal`, or `fast`. |
| Sleep after (seconds) | `60` | Idle time before the pet falls asleep. `0` keeps it awake. |
| HUD | on | The HP, MP, and ST bars below the prompt. |
| Status line | on | The text beside the pet. |
| Name files and commands | on | The status line names the file, pattern, command, host, or search query a tool works on. Turn it off to share your screen. |
| Subagent minis | on | A mini behind the pet for each running subagent. |

From a shell, pipe the values as JSON, then restart Claude Code:

```bash
echo '{"speed": "fast", "sleepAfter": "300"}' | claude plugin configure pixel-pet@pixel-pet --values-stdin
```

`claude plugin configure pixel-pet@pixel-pet` with no input lists the settings and which you have set. The install's "6 userConfig options not yet set" needs nothing from you: each setting has a default.

## Update

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update pixel-pet
claude plugin update pixel-pet@pixel-pet
```

Then start a new session. Your pet and your settings carry over. A setting the new version doesn't know takes its default, and a pet drawn for an older version still draws.

## Where it shows

The pet draws with colored text cells, so it works in any terminal with 24-bit color, without kitty graphics. The Desktop app's Code tab shows it as SVG. The VS Code chat panel, `claude -p`, and cloud sessions don't show it. The HUD shows only in the terminal.

## Privacy and security

A mod runs inside Claude Code with your permissions. pixel-pet:

- reads only its own theme files, polls session usage and the list of subagents, and draws;
- registers three tools for changing the theme: `get_theme` returns the theme on screen, `preview_theme` writes a preview page to the path Claude gives it, and `set_theme` changes the theme and keeps it in the mod's own store;
- makes no network requests, starts no processes, and reads no environment variables.

Its `tool.call` hook sees each tool's input and keeps only a short target for the status line. The status line shows the first line of a `Bash` command, cut to 24 characters; the **Name files and commands** setting turns that off.

To check this yourself, clone the repo and run `claude plugin validate plugins/pixel-pet`. Its `calls:` line lists everything the mod asks Claude Code to do.

To report a vulnerability, open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/Namenomeaning/pixel-pet/security/advisories/new).

  hooks/scene.ts                  lays out a theme's scene and draws the band with it
  hooks/preview.ts                writes the preview: every motion, face, scene, and frame of a pet

  types/index.d.ts                the mod's state, as Claude Code keeps it
  tsconfig.json                   type-checks the mod
  assets/slime.json               the default pet
  assets/duck.json                an example pet that faces to one side
  assets/alien.json               an example pet that uses every field
  skills/pixel-pet/               the skill that draws a pet with you, and the pet format
tools/preview/build.mjs           writes the preview of a theme file
tools/demo/record.mjs             records docs/images/demo.gif
docs/images/                      the images in this README
```

Load your working copy for one session with `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/pixel-pet`. Saving a file reloads the mod. Before you open a pull request, run:

```bash
claude plugin validate . --strict
claude plugin validate plugins/pixel-pet --strict
claude plugin test plugins/pixel-pet
```

`plugins/pixel-pet/tsconfig.json` extends `plugins/pixel-pet/.claude-plugin/types/tsconfig.json`, which Claude Code writes the first time it loads the mod. After one `--plugin-dir` session, `tsc -p plugins/pixel-pet` type-checks the mod. The tests don't need it.

To see every motion, face, status line, HUD look, and frame of a pet, run `node tools/preview/build.mjs [theme file]` (Node 22.18 or later) and open `tools/preview/preview.html`. It writes the same preview `preview_theme` does, for the slime when you give no file, and prints the pet's resting frame and notes on anything it repaired.

To record `docs/images/demo.gif` again after a change to the band or the HUD, run `node tools/demo/record.mjs` (Node 22.18 or later). It plays a scripted session through the mod's modules and needs Google Chrome (or its path in `CHROME`) and `ffmpeg`.

Installed copies update only when `version` in `plugins/pixel-pet/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` changes, so bump it in every release. Contributor rules are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).
